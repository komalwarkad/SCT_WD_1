üè° House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
This Python script trains a linear regression model to predict house prices based on property features. It performs the following steps:

Reads housing data from a CSV file (house_price.csv).

Selects relevant features: square_footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms.

Splits the dataset into training (80%) and test (20%) sets.

Trains a LinearRegression model on the training data.

Evaluates model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) on the test set.

Outputs the resulting MSE to the console.
